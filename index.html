        <p style="font-weight: 100; color:#606060;">Research and data is an effective tool to make progress against the world's largest problems. Our world in data is a research team based at the University of Oxford who created a worldwide database which has information about nearly all countries.All data is from the year 2020. Database can be accessed from <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators/">here.</a> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sancho17/FIT3179/main/editedcsv.csv">Here</a> is the clean one used in this visualisation</p>

            <h2>Mortality rates around the world</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 100; color:#606060;">This choropleth map shows the infant mortality rates for 1000 infants are born.San Marino was the lowest with only 6.7 and another surprising addition was Puerto Rico with just 7.3 Quite interesting as it is quite often labelled as a developing nation. You should be able to notice a higher mortality rate in Africa, with Niger having the highest number.<br><br> Use the slider to filter the data.  </span></p>

            <h2>Life expectancy vs. GDP per capita</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 100; color:#606060;">Vertical axis shows life expectancy and the horizontal shows real GDP per capita in USD. GDP is the market value of all goods and services a country produces within a certain amount of time. In this case it is data from 2020. As you can see there seems to be a relationship between GDP and life expectancy. Sadly once again Africa seems to have the lowest GDP and life expectancy. <br><br> Use the content select to select a specific continent and the GDP slider to filter by GDP </p>

            <h2>A look into unemployment rates</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 100; color:#606060;"> Uemployment rates can also give us a look into how a country is doing. Unemployment is a measure of workers who want to work but are unable to find jobs. By having a high unemployment rate the country wiil have a lower economic output. But very low unemployment can also have negative consequences such as inflation and reduced productivity. Economists recommend an unemployment rate below 6% as COVID 19 has impacted the job market. Kosovo had the highest unemployment rate while Qatar and Cambodia had the lowest </p>

          <h2>Which countries pollute the most?</h2>
          <p style="font-weight: 100; color:#606060;"> CO2(carbon dioxide) emissions per capita are measured as the total amount of CO2 divided by the total population. Countries which gain energy from renewables have much lower CO2 emissions compared to countries which gain energy from renewables. Countries which are rich in oil also are high due to oil refining.Some of the richer countries may have high CO2 due to imports from other countries. Saudi Arabia had the highest CO2 emissions per capita at 16 tons while Chad had the lowest at 0.06. <br><br> Use the slider to filter the data. </p>

            <h2>Which countries are the most connected?</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 100; color:#606060;">Internet is such a powerful tool and most people can not live without it, it is quite interesting to see that a large number of the population does not use the internet at all. Especially in developing countries such as India, Pakistan, etc. Internet usage could also be low due to other factors, for example Africa is huge and a large amount of the population live in the rural parts where it is hard to put the infrustructure in place. Another reason could be the price of internet. Somalia only has 2% of the population connected to the internet while Iceland on the other hand hat the largest at 98% <br><br> Use the slider to filter the data.</p>
